Maria Jump - April 2002

Version 1.1 - Fixes three bugs reported by users.
Nina Amenta - Feb 2002

1. Attempt to fix Linux coredumps.

2. Variable name ``or'' was changed to ``Or'' to prevent some
	pre-processors replacing it with ``||'' in setNormals.C.

3. Nasty typo "-" should have been "=" fixed in setNormals.C.
	Two users told me about this - thanks! The triangle orientation
	utility should work consistently now.
